# rst-anomaly-detection

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Python library to discover anomalies in Roman Space Telescope (RST) simulated data by means of GPUs and CPU parallelization
for high performance and commodity base environments. This repository focuses in using CNNs for the identification
of anomalies in RST sensor imagery.

## Science Questions

- Uncover anomalies in RST simulated data
- Understand sensor anomalies and plan for the future of the mission
- Use deep learning models (segmentation and object detection) to analyze anomalies in RST data
